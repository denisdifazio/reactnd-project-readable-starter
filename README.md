## Introduction

Readable is the second project of [Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) course which students were asked to build a content and comment web app.

In Readable, users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Furthermore, users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.
