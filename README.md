## Introduction

This is the second project of [Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) course which students were asked to build a content and comment web app.

In this app, users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Furthermore, users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository also includes the code for the backend API Server that was used to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.

## Instalation

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`

* Install and start the front-end
